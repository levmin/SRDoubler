SRDoubler

This program utilises bandlimited interpolation (see https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/) to double the sampling rate
of an incoming signal. Its primary application is high-fidelity computer audio playback. The implementation is written in modern C++
and has been tested on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 and Clang 5.
